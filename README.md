# perfomance
This project is an audio-reactive interactive performance implemented as a web application.
It is built with JavaScript and leverages several third-party libraries for audio processing, visualization, and real-time animation rendering.

Users can enable their microphone, speak, play music, or introduce any external sound — the interface analyzes the incoming audio stream and transforms it into dynamic visual responses. Frequency spectrum, amplitude, and rhythm serve as the foundation for the visual behavior of the page.

The project functions as an artistic exploration of modern browser capabilities, combining the Web Audio API, visualization libraries, and custom JS logic to create the feeling of a living interface that responds to the user in real time. It is a creative piece where experimentation with JavaScript becomes a medium for rethinking human interaction with digital space.
